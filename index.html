        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is James Choi. I attended high school in South Korea, but was born in San Jose, California. I attended elementary school in California and really enjoyed it, but when I heard that I had to move to South Korea, I was devastated. The move to South Korea made me extremely sad and angry to leave my friends. In the end, however, I really enjoyed my time in South Korea, and would not ask for a chance to change this fact. In high school, I made plenty of friends that shared many similar interests as I did. This was the first time I was able to relate to so many people. I did an art class in high school and found out how much I loved to be creative. I made a lot of projects and really enjoyed making all of them. I decided to do a photography project and fell in love with the camera. It was difficult to use at first, but I was able to get the hang of it. <br><br>

         Now I am much more efficient with the camera, but I still have a lot to learn about it. I got my first camera from my dad when he found out that I was interested in photography and film. This is what started my love and ambition for film. When I applied to college, I looked at the schools with film programs and other majors. At the time, I was unsure of becoming a film major as it is a difficult and unstable job. However, during my time in college I learned that I really enjoy film and really dislike jobs where I have to be seated down. I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a film major and want to become a director. I have made my first short film in my freshman year of college. It was a long and difficult process, but I really enjoyed it. I really enjoy creating stories that are dramas. I really want to get good at creating comedy action stories, as that is my favorite genre to watch. As a child I watched a lot of television, cartoons, movies, and Youtube videos. This is most likely the reason why I want to become a director.   <br><br>

         I had always enjoyed being creative and thinking of interesting storylines. I am also apart of a Korean Christian club on campus. In this club I have made some video projects for the club. This allows me to practice with the camera and editing. This was the first time where I had to edit extremely hard for a video, as most of the videos in high school only required simple edits. Despite being a Christian club, it has allowed me to widen my experience and learn many new things that I would not have originally. Some of my hobbies are filming, writing script ideas, photography, playing video games, and watching videos. In my free time, I enjoy doing these things alone and with friends.
